# The Uyghur Voice Cup  

This repository contains my work and solutions for the [Uyghur Voice Cup](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/the-uyghur-voice-cup/overview) Kaggle competition.  

The competition focuses on building models for **Uyghur speech recognition**, a challenging task given the scarcity of high-quality labeled Uyghur language datasets.

## ⚙️ Approach  

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Audio cleaning and augmentation  
   - Feature extraction (MFCCs, spectrograms, etc.)  

2. **Modeling**
   - Baseline models (Logistic Regression, SVM, etc.)  
   - Deep learning approaches (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)  

3. **Evaluation**
   - Cross-validation  
   - Final leaderboard submissions
